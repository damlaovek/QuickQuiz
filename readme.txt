~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains the codes of layouts and activities of the application and should be imported to Android Studio in order to be compiled.

This quiz application starts with a login page which takes the users name as nickname. Next, 15 questions are shown sorted according to their points and user chooses a question to answer. If the backbutton is pressed in this page, the game is discarded and a new game is started. An answered question cannot be answered again since the button is disabled. As user pickes a question, the choices and question text is shown: if the question is answered correctly, it appears green in the list, incorrectly: red and if the timer goes off or the user presses back button, it is counted as empty and displayed as blue in the list.
When no questions left, gameover screen is shown with the nickname and score.
Application does not turn into landscape when device is tilted. It works in the portrait mode.
